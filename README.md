# Introduction
The purpose of this project is to create an automatic nerf gun that is fully self-automated. We created this device as apart of our ME 405 Term Project, 
which consists of code we've written over the quarter. This design is intended for anyone who likes to channel their inner-child self and want to blast 
someone which nerf darts without pulling a trigger. Our design consists of four motors, a themal camera, and a solenoid. We controlled two of the motors 
apart of this design in order to provide a yaw and a pitch rotation. The other two motors are apart of a nerf gun kit that accelerate two flywheels that 
provides the force to launch the darts. We also used a thermal camera so that the system could recognize where someone is based on the temperature 
readings. Within our thermal system design, we are setting the yaw and pitch to a desired angle to position the gun in the direction of the person. In 
order to load a dart into the gun, we used a solenoid that pushes the darts in the spinning flywheels. To make the project more fun, we decided to make 
our gun fully automatic, launching 15 darts within 2 seconds by retracting and pushing the solenoid fifteen times.
